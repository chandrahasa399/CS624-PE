Input:
The input for this program is static data, including the user's name, degree program, and school. These values are hardcoded within the `Text` components of the React Native app, meaning no external or dynamic input is required. The input consists of three strings: "Chandrahasa Munagala," "MSCS," and "City University of Seattle."

Process:
The program utilizes React Native components to render the user information on the screen. The view component acts as the container for the content, positioning it at the center of the screen with the help of Flexbox styling. Three `Text` components display the name, degree program, and school on the screen. The StyleSheet component is used to apply styling, including setting the background color to yellow, adjusting the text size, and centering the content. The StatusBar component is also used to configure the app's status bar style.

Output:
The output is a simple mobile screen with the user's name, degree program, and school displayed on a yellow background. The text is centered and properly spaced for readability.
